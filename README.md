              PROJECT NAME: GSM BASED ELECTRICITY TOP-UP

DESCRIPTION: 
               This is project is a system that allows users to recharge their prepaid meters with mobile money.
                The system works with a GSM mode activator as a triger, the user receives a text message when the credit on the 
                meter reaches 80%, the user can then send the required amount he or she wants to buy. An sms will be sent to the 
                meter with the value of the amount the user wants to purchase, the value is then converted into kilowatts on the 
                meter for consumption.
